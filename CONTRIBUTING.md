I genuinely believe that a community-maintained database will serve the
transposon research the best in the long-term. Active participation in
annotating unclassified consensus sequences, establishing and optimizing
profile-HMMs of TE proteins are very much needed. "RepeatDefeaters" should
be a resource center that is reviewed and contributed by many, therefore
the plural name.
